pip install the requirements.txt
manually place the AutodockTools python3 translation folders on the site-package folder of python - AutoDockTools, Pybabel, Molkit and mglutil

step 2 
make anaconda 2 environment

1st env
-conda install -c conda-forge smina
-conda install -c conda-forge openbabel

2nd env
- conda install -c conda-forge plip
- conda install -c conda-forge pymol-open-source

extract both environement separetely using conda-pack
tar -xzvf the tar.gz compressed output of conda-pack in cmd
name env1 as hey
name env2 as heya1
put both in G directory in MzDOCK
